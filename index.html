<div class="centered"><h1>For the Love of Guitars</h1>
The first guitars are thought to have originated during the 15th Century in Spain. These had four 'courses' of strings or sets of two strings tuned to the same note to give the guitar resonance.
However the Lute was consistently favored by the public over the Guitar until the end of the 15th Century.</div>

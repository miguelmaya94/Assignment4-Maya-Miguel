<div class="centered"><h1>For the Love of Guitars</h1>
The first guitars are thought to have originated during the <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">15th Century</span> in Spain. These had four 'courses' of strings or sets of two strings tuned to the same note to give the guitar resonance.
However the Lute was consistently favored by the public over the Guitar until the end of the 15th Century.

  <h3>For the Love of Acoustic</h3>
  <p>Although steel-stringed acoustic guitars are now used all over the world, the person who is thought to have created the first of these guitars was a German immigrant to the United States named Christian Frederick Martin <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">(1796-1867)</span>. Guitars at the time used so-called catgut strings created from the intestines of sheep. Martin, however, decided to create a guitar that used steel strings so that banjo players playing the then-popular style of country music could switch over and play without any discomfort.</p>

    <h3>For the Love of Amplifiers</h3>
    <p>Beauchamp and Rickenbacke would go on to form the Electro String company, and would create the first production-model dedicated electric guitar amplifier in <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">1932</span>. After creating this model, the company hired an engineer, Ralph Robertson, to improve their amplifier design. Robertson would go on to develop new circuitry that would put Electro String amps far above all other competition, to the point where their amps would inspire the designs of others.</p>

    <h3>For the Love of Electricity</h3>
    <p>Although guitars have a long history, they had fallen behind the times in a way-especially in terms of volume-as many others instruments had been modified over the years.It was around <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">1936</span> when a jazz guitarist named Charlie Christian <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">(1916-1942)</span> began using an acoustic guitar with a pickup attached to the body, with the intention of playing guitar solos in his band. This is said to be the birth of the electric guitar.</p>
